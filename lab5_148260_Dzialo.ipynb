A Horn clause is an *implication* such that its *premise* (*left-hand side*) is a *disjunction* of *atoms* (i.e., *propositonal symbols* or *propositional variables*) and its *conclusion* (*right-hand side*) is a single atom.\n",

        "An implication with a single atom in the premise is also a Horn clause (e.g., $p\\to q$).

We can easily write its contrapositive: *If there isn't a pit in one of the directly adjacent squares, then a square isn't breezy.*.
