        "Depth-first search and breadth-first search considered in the previous lesson are completely *blind* algorithms: they're only concerned whether the currently considered state is a goal state or not. They're unable to distinguish whether a state is easy or hard to reach, or whether it is near or far of the goal. This makes them very inefficient search algorithms. To allievate the issue, we introduce informed search algorithms. The information is given to an algorithm in two ways:\n",
